		Dental or oral health is concerned with your teeth, gums and mouth. The goal is to prevent complications such as tooth 

		decay (cavities) and gum disease and to maintain the overall health of your mouth.
A healthy mouth, free of infections, injuries and other problems with teeth and gums, is important in maintaining your overall health.

Although a different set of medical professionals focuses on dental health, they are still part of your regular health care team.

Disease and other conditions can affect your dental health and dental problems can affect other parts of your body. Failing to properly care for your oral health may lead to other health problems.


You can help prevent or minimize many oral health problems by regular preventive steps (brushing, flossing and so on) and regular visits to dental health professionals.

Injuries to mouth
Injuries to the mouth and teeth can cause problems, especially for young people playing sports. Make sure young (and not so young) athletes use a properly fitted mouth guard, especially when playing contact sports or engaging is activities where falls and blows to the mouth are possible.

Dental health begins shortly after birth and continues the rest of your life. Constant and consistent oral health habits come from habits and patterns established as children under the direction of a parent.

Good oral health practices and regular visits to dental health professionals will help you enjoy the benefits of a bright smile and a pain-free mouth.

If you begin good oral health practices at an early age and stick with them through adulthood, the odds are good that you will have a healthy mouth, pleasant breath, strong teeth and a bright smile.

Even if you have let dental problems develop over time, it is never too late to see a dental health professional for corrective procedures. Thanks to modern practices, much of the pain some people fear is gone from dental health procedures.

			<p><h3>Dental Bridge</h3>
     If you have missing teeth, your dentist can close â€” or bridge â€” the gaps in your smile with dental bridges. A dental bridge is a false tooth (called a pontic) that is held in place by the abutment teeth on either side of the gap. Although pontics can be made from a variety of materials such as gold, typically theyâ€™re made from porcelain to aesthetically blend in with your natural teeth.
     A traditional dental bridge consists of a false tooth or teeth being held in place by dental crowns that have been cemented onto each of the abutment teeth. A traditional bridge is the most popular type of dental bridge and can be used when you have natural teeth on both sides of the gap created by your missing tooth.

     Prospective doctors need to be accepted to an accredited medical school which typically requires completing an undergraduate pre-med program. That includes taking significant coursework in biology, anatomy and physiology, chemistry, and general science. Medical school is a four-year program. The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) accredits medical school programs that grant an M.D. degree. Osteopathic medical school programs (those that confer a D.O. degree) receive accreditation from the American Osteopathic Association Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA)
Training: Medical school is followed by a residency training program that typically lasts anywhere from three to seven years, depending on specialty.
Although similar to a traditional bridge, the pontic in a cantilever dental bridge is held in place by a dental crown that is cemented to only one abutment tooth. For a cantilever bridge, you only need one natural tooth next to the missing tooth gap.
Similar to a traditional bridge, Maryland dental bridges employ two natural abutment teeth, one on each side of the gap. However, while a traditional bridge uses dental crowns on the abutment teeth, a Maryland bridge uses a framework of either metal or porcelain that is bonded onto the backs of the abutment teeth.

Like a traditional bridge, a Maryland bridge can only be used when you have a natural tooth on each side of the gap caused by the missing tooth or teeth.

   <h1>Cavity Filling</h1>
   <p>A filling is one of the most common dental procedures. Itâ€™s basically a repair job to fix the damage done by tooth decay. Itâ€™s typically a painless procedure that takes about an hour.

Cavities are incredibly common nowadays. According to the World Health Organization, untreated cavities are the most common dental condition worldwide, experienced by approximately 2 billion people with permanent teeth (adults).

A filling helps prevent further decay and allows your tooth to function as expected.

Keep reading to learn more about what to expect if you need a filling, the materials most commonly used, and how long it takes for a filling to set and heal.

How long does it take to get a filling?
In general, a filling takes an hour or less. A simple filling may take as few as 20 minutes. Many dental offices now have the technology to make onlays and inlays in one appointment, though a larger filling or multiple fillings can take longer.

Plus, depending on the materials used for the filling, it could take longer or require a second visit. For instance:

Composite resin material thatâ€™s layered into your tooth takes more time, but itâ€™s completed in one visit.
Some composite fillings may be made from an impression. This requires a second visit to bond the filling.
Gold or porcelain fillings, also called inlays or onlays, can only be done in one sitting if your dental office has the require equipment. Otherwise, it takes multiple visits. In the first visit, the dentist will remove the cavity and make impression of your tooth. Theyâ€™ll send the impression to a lab to create the filling. At the next visit, theyâ€™ll bond the filling to your tooth.
Replacing an older filling generally takes about the same amount of time as the original filling. It may take slightly longer if the old filling material has to be drilled out. A healthcare professional will clean out the cavity and old filling material, then insert new filling material.</p>

   	<h1>Bleeching</h1>
   	<p>Teeth cleaning, along with whitening and bleaching is done with utmost care, for a smile that looks not just beautiful, but also healthy.Want a brighter smile? When it comes to tooth-whitening, you've got two options: in-office-based teeth bleaching, or at-home care.

Both tooth-whitening options use peroxide-based bleaching agents. At-home systems contain from 3% to 20% peroxide (carbamide or hydrogen peroxides). In-office systems contain from 15% to 43% peroxide.

Generally, the longer you keep a stronger solution on your teeth, the whiter your teeth become. However, the higher the percentage of peroxide in the whitening solution, the shorter it should be applied to the teeth. Keeping the gel on longer will dehydrate the tooth and increase tooth sensitivity.</p>
